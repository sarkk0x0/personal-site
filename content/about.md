Heyy, I am Abdulrahman.

I am a Software Engineer in Lagos, Nigeria. This blog is my virtual space
where I document topics I am interested in.

You could find me writing about Backend Engineering, Distributed sytems or Embedded Systems.
I also play around with Python, Golang and Rust.

If you want to talk about Software Engineering, Fantasy books, games or music, you can reach me via
[email](mailto:solankerahman@gmail.com) or connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Sarkk_).

Cheers
